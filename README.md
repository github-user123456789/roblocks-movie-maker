Hello
I wil add the movie player source later Yea
But here is how you make a movie

### OK I added the source code to the movie playe./r
Please Ignore Most Of The Comments. They Make No Sense . . . .. . . .. ... ,a.falgkaegl BTW i don;/t know why i co;ded it like thart


## STEP 1

make table

## STEP 2

copy thos example frame and edit it

```
{
	time = 0,
	ends = 2,
	display = "title1",
	content = "test",
	transition = "ZoomIn"
}
```

currently title1 is the only display option
content is the text

time is when it starts
ends is duration

### current transitions:
* ZoomIn
* SpinIn
* FlyInTopLeft
* Mirror

### Here is an example of adding an image

```
{
	time = 0,
	ends = 2,
	display = "",
	bgimage = "rbxassetid://11673018605"
}
```

display is set to a mode that doesnt exist so that it wont try to add text

### background color
background color changing not rly added yet
