Hello
I wil add the movie player source later Yea
But here is how you make a movie


## STEP 1

make table

## STEP 2

copy thos example frame and edit it

{
		time = 0,
		ends = 2,
		display = "title1",
		content = "test",
		transition = "ZoomIn"
},

currently title1 is the only display option
content is the text

time is when it starts
ends is duration

### current transitions:
ZoomIn
SpinIn
FlyInTopLeft

### Here is an example of adding an image

{
	time = 0,
	ends = 2,
	display = "",
	bgimage = "rbxassetid://11673018605"
},

display is set to a mode that doesnt exist so that it wont try to add text

### background color
background color changing not rly added yet
